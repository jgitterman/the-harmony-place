        <h2>About THP</h2>
        <p>The Harmony Place (THP) is a non-profit that was created with the purpose of helping individuals and families
          in the community
          who have suffered and/or are currently struggling with the long-lasting effects of debilitating traumas. As a
          collaborative team, we came up with a combination of treatments that we personally have tested and found
          effective in reclaiming our lives after experiencing various types of traumas. We’ve created a structured
          peer to peer support group along with other adjunctive therapies open to the public.</p>

        <h2 id="founder">About The Founder</h2>
        <p>The Harmony Place was started by a woman from the Caribbean who migrated to the United States many years
          ago, in an effort to outrun the lasting negative effects from the physical, mental, and sexual abuse she
          experienced. In America, she began to experiment with different methods of healing. After years of trial and
          error, she was able to put together a combination that was very effective in putting her on a road to
          recovery.</p>
        <div class="container mb-3"><img class="marvPic" src="../assets/images/20140720_163549.jpg" alt="pic of marv">
        </div>
        <p>That woman is me, Marvlyn Vincent. And today, I can honestly say that I have found a way to take back what
          was repeatedly stolen from me as a child, through my developmental years, and as a young adult. From an early
          age, I learned what it meant to survive, and today I am much more than a survivor; I am living proof that you
          can find your way to becoming the person that you’ve dreamt of becoming. I am a firm believer in this truth,
          “You’re not who you were born, you are who you choose to become.” I went through years of being victimized,
          but I was never a victim. I was always a survivor, choosing to believe that the only victims were the ones
          utilizing an abuse of power. After years of utilizing various forms of therapies, I have finally found both
          freedom and lasting inner peace. It has since become not only my deepest desire but also my strongest passion
          to share with others what freed me from the bondage and chains of my past. That is why I created The Harmony
          Place.</p>

                  <p>Tania C Connors BSN, RN, a first generation Latina, graduated from Felician
                    University cum laude in 2010 with her Bachelors of Science in Nursing. She has predominantly
                    worked in Pediatric home care. For four years she worked throughout New Jersey as a case manager for
                    infants and children coming home from the NICU/PICU. She was able to observe over a thousand clients
                    and
                    their families come home and noted the levels of anxiety in the children as well as the families. To
                    better help understand and serve her clients better she educated herself about child development,
                    infant/maternal bonds, and PTSD.</br>
                    </br>
                    In 2012, Tania was sexually assaulted. At the time she was working as a case manager and
                    attending graduate school to obtain her pediatric nurse practitioner certification. Her world
                    stopped.
                    PTSD took over. Thanks to her Nursing education, Tania was able to find herself the mental health
                    assistance she needed within a week of her assault including completing Prolonged Exposure Therapy
                    for
                    the
                    trauma. Although Tania had to withdrawal from graduate school, she never stopped educating herself.
                    In
                    the last 6.5 years, Tania has dedicated her life to healing, learning, and growing after trauma as
                    well
                    as helping/supporting others as much as she can with their trauma along the way. She currently
                    works as a substitute School Nurse throughout Mercer County School Districts.</br>
                    </br>
                    It is an honor to be part of The Harmony Place Board. Tania and her husband, Derek, truly
                    believe in the services and support The Harmony Place aims to provide the community.</p>

                  <p>Robin is an entrepreneur and mother of three. Throughout her accomplished career,
                    she has owned and operated three successful dance studios in the central New Jersey area. She
                    has been a pillar of her community, helping families and children achieve their dreams.</br>
                    </br>
                    However, with great success also came a tremendous amount of pain and suffering. After enduring
                    violence and abuse, she unexpectedly lost her husband and was left to raise two children (under
                    the age of five) on her own. Two weeks after the death of her husband, she suddenly lost the closet
                    male
                    figure in her life, her beloved father.</br>
                    </br>
                    Robin has now endeavored to continue giving back to the community by doing whatever she can to
                    help those suffering from the effects of trauma and sudden loss. She vows to be there for others and
                    help guide them in their individual healing processes. She understands the power that can be gained
                    by utilizing the help of others.</p>

                  <p>Cayla Bailey is a doctoral student in clinical psychology at Chestnut Hill College
                    in Philadelphia. She graduated with her bachelors in psychology Summa Cum Laude
                    from Rutgers University in 2018. She has worked with individuals suffering from
                    substance use disorder, trauma, and sexuality concerns including sexual identity
                    and sexual trauma. She is strongly focused on inequality, diversity and multicultural

                    adverse life experiences to fulfill her dreams of becoming a Doctor of clinical
                    psychology in hopes to be able to help individuals in the community who have
                    experienced trauma and marginalization. Her main goal is to help survivors feel
                    accepted on their own terms and to help them overcome their ordeals in order to
                    live happy and healthy lives.</br>
                    </br>
                    It is her strong sense of social advocacy and compulsion to help aide in the plight of others

                  <p>Derek Connors is currently a special education instructional assistant working in
                    Princeton Public Schools. Derek began his career in education in 2015. Having attended Bound
                    Brook
                    public schools and worked in neighboring Manville, both Somerset County districts chronically
                    underfunded and the towns economically devastated due to flooding, Derek understands how
                    socioeconomic
                    status and inadequate education can contribute to trauma later in life.</br>
                    </br>
                    Derek holds a Bachelor’s degree in History from Montclair State University and an Associate’s in
                    Education from Raritan Valley Community College. He is also an Eagle Scout.</br>
                    </br>
                    It’s Derek’s philosophical approach as an educator, his life experiences with trauma and his
                    desire to
                    find ways to overcome, and help others overcome, the PTSD many of us experience in life that
                    brought
                    him to The Harmony Place.</p>

                  <p>Tara Lorenzetti is currently a graduate student at Rider University. As a highly empathetic
                    person, she was drawn to the field of psychology and is very passionate about mental health. It
                    is Tara's hope that together we can help each other function day to day and provide support to
                    those in need. As said by Michelle Rosenthal, "Trauma creates change you don't choose. Healing
                    is about creating change you do choose." Everyone has scars that no one else can see, and
                    sometimes those are the ones that hurt the most. Therefore, she is a strong advocate for mental
                    health awareness.</p>

                  <p>I feel so blessed to be given the opportunity to help build an organization whose
                    goal it is to help others. I have survived where so many never stood a chance. I have had a
                    front row seat to abuse, violence, and homelessness. I have survived drug addiction that led down a
                    long
                    dark road. But I am alive. And moreso, I am a living testimony that asking for help can and will
                    save
                    your life. Presently, I work at an outpatient drug and alcohol rehab where I can share in my
